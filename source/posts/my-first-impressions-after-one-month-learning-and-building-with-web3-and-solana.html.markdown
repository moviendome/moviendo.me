I've been learning and building with <strong>Web3</strong> for almost one month and I have to say that it's mind blowing and more having a background working with Traditional Payment Systems.

The best of this New Internet is that <strong>Web3 is Frictionless and Permissionless.</strong> Develop products and services with Traditional Payment Systems is the opposite and can be tough! Old technologies and systems, poor APIs or no API at all, tons of old style documentation and no help with issues in places like StackOverflow and similar, issues have to be solved by provider, usually for $$$.

Back to <strong>Web3</strong>, starting is easy peasy. For example, **I built my OWN BANK in a few weeks!**

## Ownership

I've been able to build my own Wallet App where I'm the only one that have the Private Keys.

Also, I can create all the accounts that I need to separate my money: personal, donations, savings... and best! **FREE and without maintenance fees**.

## Free Testing Environment

While I was building it I had access to a complete testing environment with:

- NO register
- NO approvals
- NO KYC

**100% FREE**

I built in some Traditional Payment Systems before where there was NO Testing Environment, something that I still cannot understand.

## Go to Production

When I wanted to do real transactions in the Mainnet:

- NO register
- NO approvals
- NO KYC

**Almost FREE, only $0.00025** (avg. cost per transaction) with [Solana](https://solana.com/).

## Freedom

I could decide to use other Wallets only introducing my seed phrase to have access to many services like DEX (Decentralized Exchanges), Staking Services...

- NO register
- NO approvals
- NO KYC

**100% FREE**

I'm the owner of my Private Keys and I decide what I do with them.

## Conclusion

Web3, Blockchain, Decentralization... will bring infinite possibilities and a more open environment where anyone can start building products and services.

It's a game changer!
