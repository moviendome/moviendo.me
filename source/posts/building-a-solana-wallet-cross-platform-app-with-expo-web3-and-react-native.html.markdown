</div>

As a developer I've been interested in the Blockchain space for long time and although a few years ago I started to learn Solidity for fun I didn't build something real.

Few weeks ago, having a coffee in one of my favorite places here in the island I started to read about [Solana](https://solana.com/) and I found some easy Node scripts to do the basic operations with Web3 so I did one of the most dangerous things you can do :D

~~~bash
$ expo init solana-wallet
~~~

I thought that build a basic Wallet App could be a good introduction to **Solana and Web3** and let me practice more with Expo and React Native.

So I spent the rest of the weekend and some time more the next week **building a fully functional Cross-Platform Solana Wallet App**.


## Screens and Features

The App is really simple. For now, it has these:

### Welcome

This screen only shows a button to start!

<div class="content-image" markdown="1">
  ![](building-a-solana-wallet-cross-platform-app-with-expo-web3-and-react-native/welcome.png)
</div>

### Create your passcode

This screen let you create a passcode that for now is only requested when you want to see your recovery phrase.

Later, it can be used to encrypt the seed, before doing a transfer or even to access to the full app.

<div class="content-image" markdown="1">
  ![](building-a-solana-wallet-cross-platform-app-with-expo-web3-and-react-native/passcode.png)
</div>

### Dashboard

This screen shows the account balance and soon it will show the Activity of the account.

Also, it is where I placed the Navigation using a floating action button (component provided by [React Native Paper](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/fab-group.html))

<div class="content-image" markdown="1">
  ![](building-a-solana-wallet-cross-platform-app-with-expo-web3-and-react-native/dashboard.png)
</div>

Get account balance with web3:

~~~javascript
const getBalance = async (publicKey) => {
  const connection = createConnection();
  const _publicKey = publicKeyFromString(publicKey);

  const lamports = await connection.getBalance(_publicKey).catch((err) => {
    console.error(`Error: ${err}`);
  });

  const sol = lamports / LAMPORTS_PER_SOL;
  return sol;
};
~~~

### Receive

This screen shows the address and a qr to make easier receive tokens.

<div class="content-image" markdown="1">
  ![](building-a-solana-wallet-cross-platform-app-with-expo-web3-and-react-native/receive.png)
</div>

### Send

This screen allows you to send tokens to other accounts typing the address or scanning a qr code.

Also, this screen shows the current price of SOL, SOL available in the account and convert the introduced amount to USD.

Validations are pending!

<div class="content-image" markdown="1">
  ![](building-a-solana-wallet-cross-platform-app-with-expo-web3-and-react-native/send.png)
</div>

Create transaction with web3:

~~~javascript
const transaction = async (from, to, amount) => {
  const account = accountFromSeed(from.seed);

  console.log("Executing transaction...");
  console.log(amount);

  const transaction = new solanaWeb3.Transaction().add(
    solanaWeb3.SystemProgram.transfer({
      fromPubkey: publicKeyFromString(from.account),
      toPubkey: publicKeyFromString(to),
      lamports: amount * LAMPORTS_PER_SOL,
    })
  );

  // Sign transaction, broadcast, and confirm
  const connection = createConnection();
  const signature = await solanaWeb3.sendAndConfirmTransaction(
    connection,
    transaction,
    [account]
  );
  console.log("SIGNATURE", signature);
};

~~~

Get Solana price using [Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com) API:

~~~javascript
const getSolanaPrice = async () => {
  const response = await fetch(
    `https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/simple/price?ids=solana&vs_currencies=usd`,
    {
      method: "GET",
    }
  );

  const data = await response.json();
  return data.solana.usd;
};

~~~

### Settings

This screen shows two options:

<div class="content-image" markdown="1">
  ![](building-a-solana-wallet-cross-platform-app-with-expo-web3-and-react-native/settings.png)
</div>

#### Backup

To access to recovery phrase. Before ask for passcode.

#### Request Airdrop

This app is configured to connect to dev network so the tokens showed are not real.

Good thing is that every time you press here you get 1 SOL in your account that can be used to test the app, make transfers...

Request an Airdrop in dev mode with web3:

~~~javascript
const requestAirDrop = async (publicKeyString: string) => {
  const connection = createConnection();

  const airdropSignature = await connection.requestAirdrop(
    publicKeyFromString(publicKeyString),
    LAMPORTS_PER_SOL
  );

  const signature = await connection.confirmTransaction(airdropSignature);
  return signature;
};
~~~

## What I used to build this Solana Wallet

### Expo
Expo is an open-source platform for making universal native apps for Android, iOS, and the web with JavaScript and React.
 - [Expo](https://expo.io/)


### Solana/web3.js
This is the Solana Javascript API built on the Solana JSON RPC API.
 - [Solana/web3.js](https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/)

### Easy Peasy
Vegetarian friendly state for React.
 - [Easy Peasy](https://easy-peasy.vercel.app/)

### React Native Paper
Paper is a collection of customizable and production-ready components for React Native, following Googleâ€™s Material Design guidelines.
 - [React Native Paper](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/)

### React Navigation
Routing and navigation for Expo and React Native apps.
 - [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/)

### More

Moreover I used other libraries for crypto, qr generate and scan...

You can check them in [package.json](https://github.com/jferrer/expo-solana-wallet/blob/main/package.json)

## Problems that I found and workarounds to solve them

### Crypto dependency

`solana/web3.js` needs `Crypto` that it seems that now it's included in NodeJS but no in React Native and although I found some ways to have it working in React Native I didn't find a way to do it without ejecting the app from Expo.

Finally I found a workaround that basically uses `ethers.js` and `expo-random` to be able to generate mnemonic and seed. Later, I was able to use `solana/web3.js` without issues to connect to the network, get balance, transfer...

~~~javascript
const generateMnemonic = async () => {
  const randomBytes = await Random.getRandomBytesAsync(32);
  const mnemonic = ethers.utils.entropyToMnemonic(randomBytes);
  return mnemonic;
};

const mnemonicToSeed = async (mnemonic: string) => {
   const bip39 = await import("bip39");
   const seed = await bip39.mnemonicToSeed(mnemonic);
   return Buffer.from(seed).toString("hex");
};

const accountFromSeed = (seed: string) => {
  const hex = Uint8Array.from(Buffer.from(seed));
  const keyPair = nacl.sign.keyPair.fromSeed(hex.slice(0, 32));
  const account = new solanaWeb3.Account(keyPair.secretKey);
  return account;
};
~~~

### Metro has encountered an error trying to resolve module 'superstruct'

Here the problem seems to be that the package entrypoint is a CommmonJS file. To solve it I added `.cjs` files to `metro.config.js`

~~~javascript
module.exports = {
  resolver: {
    sourceExts: ["jsx", "js", "ts", "tsx", "cjs"],
  },
};
~~~

### Some RN URL methods have no implementation

React Native `react-native/Libraries/Blob/URL.js` has no implementation for some methods.

Before, I was changing the 2 methods (`protocol` and `port`) manually but every time that I run `yarn` back to normal.

After a bit of research it seems that RN doesn't include this because the full implementation will increase a lot the size of the bundle but can be solved adding `react-native-url-polyfill` package.

~~~bash
$ yarn add react-native-url-polyfill
~~~

~~~javascript
# App.tsx
...
import "react-native-url-polyfill/auto";
...
~~~


## What's next

- Continue cleaning the code and remove packages that I'm not using anymore.
- Design doesn't adjust well. I used a [Background](https://www.freepik.com/free-vector/retro-futuristic-landscape-background-with-sun_5072269.htm#page=1&query=sun%20future&position=12) only to see it nice when I was building.
- Give option to connect to Mainnet.
- Let the option to generate derived accounts, encrypt seed phrase...
- Integration with [Serum](https://projectserum.com/#/) for Swaps.
- Run as Browser Extension.

## Final
My goal with this was to learn the Web3 basics building something simple and sharing 100% of the code between Web and Native.

I think it has been a good introduction to see how Web3 works.

If you think that it can be useful for you I published the repo [here](https://github.com/jferrer/expo-solana-wallet).

~~~bash
$ git clone https://github.com/jferrer/expo-solana-wallet.git
$ cd expo-solana-wallet
$ yarn install
$ expo web or expo start
